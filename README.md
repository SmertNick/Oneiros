It's a prototype with a core concept of switching visuals(and audio) between 2 different styles (themes), while maintaining the same gameplay.

Controls are mentioned in the options menu within the game, but just in case:

WASD - move

Space - shoot

Q - switch theme


Still requires some work:

Player death

make collectibles more versatile

and just in general more modularity


PS. RubyController.cs is PlayerController
